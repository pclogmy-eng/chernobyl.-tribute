        <p>On <b>April 26, 1986</b>, the silence of the night was shattered by an explosion that echoed across history. The Chernobyl nuclear reactor, once a symbol of Soviet progress, became the epicenter of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Radiation poured into the sky, lives were uprooted, and a ghost city named <b><abbr title="Pripyat, northern Ukraine near the Belarus border">Pripyat</abbr></b> was born overnight. But amid the chaos, scientists and workers risked 
            ';everything to contain the invisible enemy. This is not just a story of failure—it’s a story of courage, sacrifice, and the haunting legacy of atomic power.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to Nuclear Power Plants</h2>
        <p>Nuclear power plants are facilities that generate electricity using heat from nuclear fission. This process splits atoms—usually uranium or plutonium—releasing massive energy. The heat turns water into steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity.</p>

            <h2>How Nuclear Power Plants Work?</h2>
            <p>A nuclear reactor contains fuel rods made of <b>uranium-235 or plutonium-239</b>. When atoms split, they release neutrons and heat. Control rods absorb excess neutrons to regulate the reaction. The heat converts water into steam, powering turbines connected to generators.</p>

            <h2>Key Aftereffects of the Chernobyl Disaster:</h2>
            <h3>1. Human Health Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Immediate deaths:</b> Two plant workers died on the night of the explosion; 28 more died within weeks from acute radiation syndrome.</li>

                <li><b>Long-term effects:</b> Thousands developed radiation-induced illnesses, especially thyroid cancer due to exposure to iodine-131.</li>

                <li><b>Psychological trauma:</b> Anxiety, depression, and PTSD were widespread among evacuees and cleanup workers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Environmental Contamination</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Radioactive fallout:</b> Released isotopes like cesium-137 (half-life: 30 years) contaminated soil, water, and air across Europe</li>

                <li><b>Exclusion zone:</b> A 30 km radius around the plant remains largely uninhabited due to persistent radiation.</li>

                <li><b>Wildlife impact:</b> Some species thrived due to lack of human activity, but mutations and population shifts were observed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Economic & Social Disruption</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Evacuation:</b> Over 350,000 people were displaced from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.</li>
                <li><b>Agriculture:</b> Farmland was rendered unusable for decades due to radioactive contamination.</li>
                <li><b>Cost:</b> Cleanup, compensation, and containment efforts cost hundreds of billions of dollars.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Political & Scientific Consequences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Soviet secrecy:</b> Initial cover-up eroded public trust and accelerated the USSR’s political decline.</li>

                <li><b>Global reforms:</b> Led to the creation of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) and stricter international safety protocols.</li>

                <li><b>Scientific legacy:</b> Valery Legasov’s testimony exposed flaws in reactor design and inspired transparency in nuclear science</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Chernobyl disaster was more than a technological failure—it was a human tragedy etched into history by silence, sacrifice, and radioactive dust. It revealed the cost of secrecy and the courage of those who stood against it. From the scorched control room to the ghost town of Pripyat, every shadow tells a story of lives interrupted, lessons learned, and a world forever changed. Let this site be a tribute—not just to the science, but to the souls who bore its weight.</p>
